Yet, in that line, there was no one to ensure customers were maintaining distance from one another. (And most were standing within 2 ft of each other.) When I went back to Ralphs the next week, there was no such crowd control and customers were not maintaining a 6-ft distance inside. At one point I was in the produce section and an Instacart driver came right up to where I was standing (less than 2 ft away), seemingly oblivious. And people were cramped toward the checkout area as well.

Most local grocery stores have implemented social distancing guidelines and have marked the floor near registers in 6’ increments. Some stores have installed plexiglass at the registers and some are allowing only a certain number of customers in at a time. These standards seem to be more prevalent with the higher end grocery markets such as Trader Joe’s, Safeway, and Costco. Walmart has failed on many levels of social distancing. My daughter works for Walmart in Anderson, CA and she has told me that Walmart is not limiting the number of customers at a time in the store and just recently provided their employees with PPE. My daughter has observed several employees displaying sickness while still working. 
Unfortunately, for the majority of Shasta County population, people are not taking this health crisis seriously, perhaps due to the lower level of education in the county. ",California,Shasta County,

Many businesses like liquor stores and nurseries have gone curbside pick up.

I do notice many landscaping companies not complying with best practice of separate vehicles. My company (tree care/landscaping) went to separate vehicles as soon as schools closed in March. We only work where we can stay away from sidewalks and other people. Separate tools as well. Masks.

The mayor's wife (Bloomington) came down with the virus and is hospitalized.  The mayor was at the farmer's market opening greeting people without a mask or gloves just prior to his wife falling ill.

Grocery stores see differing levels of mask use.  The store I use most people are masked.  Another store near a gathering spot for many people experiencing homelessness is kind of scary. They are limiting the number of customers in at a time.

Everything shut down here just before spring break (3rd week of March?), however many people went on spring break came back; either because they lived here or had to gather their belongings.

I don't think the idea of masks protecting others has really taken hold, even for 'smart' people. ",Indiana,Monroe County,

There were people out in bars not obeying social distancing on March 14 resulting in an official order to close all restaurants and bars (except for take out) as of March 15.  While our official stay at home order did not take effect until March 23, state leadership made it clear that we were to stay home and social distance - I would say we achieved 80% compliance with that recommendation after the restaurant closures and then moved to about 95% compliance with that after the stay at home order took effect. Non-essential surgeries were postponed by most if not all departments at Ohio State Med Center by March 18, with the elimination of non-essential office visits and rapid implementation of tele health at the same time.

I used the 28th as the shelter in place because it is much more restrictive but applies to Tulsa only. Since we have not been going into stores ans ordering only I cannot comment on how people are doing inside of stores like groceries. I believe there is distancing being enforced from what I have been told. I have been impressed by how well neighbors and others are complying with distancing. People wave from their porches. In some ways the neighborhood has become more friendly because we are all out in our front yards periodically talking across our properties (about 1/5 acre lots or so) or from across the street. I work in a hospital as a physician so am distancing from my family even in my house and on our walks. In the hospital once I have finished seeing patients I am also distancing from colleagues while I do my charts and many other doctors are doing the same. Tulsa is doing a good job and I am hoping we are going to be far below predictions but I know it is still early. I have heard outlying areas are not being as careful unfortunately.

Canby City government closed on March 13th, which included all public buildings (library, aquatic center etc.) and have yet to reopen. Local churches advertise online services on their reader boards and even the local veterinarian has switched to ""drive thru"" services - asking owners to call ahead for 'curbside pick up' of food, medications and treatments. We have a large population in the city of elderly & retired individuals, including a large retirement and assisted living community. I would like to think that we are aware of our vulnerable neighbors. 

I work at the City of Wilsonville, which is also within Clackamas County. Our buildings have been closed to the public since March 17th, remaining open to provide essential services. Some employees have been approved to work remotely, but most are required to be present on site. City government closures have varied in the area - Canby closed their administrative offices, but cities like Wilsonville, West Linn, Molalla, and Lake Oswego have remained 'open' - buildings closed to the public with some employees working remotely but essential services are uninterrupted.

Three weeks ago my wife and I returned from a two month trip traveling by car to the West Coast. On our return, the State was was requiring folks returning from outside the state to quarantine for two weeks. Yesterday was my first visit out of the house in around three weeks. I was happy to see that Hannaford's, our local food store, had created a safe environment. All aisles were clearly marked one way, checkout aisles were marked with large circles at six foot intervals, and an employee was enforcing the requirement and directing people to available checkouts. Areas that usually involve contact between staff and shoppers (i.e. deli counter, fresh fish and meat counter) were closed. Items usually purchased there were prepackaged. I would estimate that 90 to 95% of shoppers were masked and many also wore gloves. All staff wore protection. Reusable bags were allowed only if you bagged them yourself and had to be filled while in your shopping cart. Employees enforced the rules and people complied without questioning the rationale. However, the six foot rule was difficult to adhere. I live in a very rural area and stores typically are uncrowded. (one of the plusses among many) It must be very difficult in urban areas to stay six feet apart in a grocery store.",Vermont,Orange County,

We started pick up at stores and we use insta cart. My daughter is a nurse and we did not want to take any chances with my granddaughters. They are staying with us. They have been, since the shelter in place started. Maybe twice a week my daughter and son-in-law come over and we stay outside more than 6 feet apart so they get to see their children.  My younger daughter who has a son who is 2 1/2 was pregnant. I have seen the birth of all three of my grandchildren. I’m sure it would not seem like much to others but it was very hard for me to not be there to witness the birth of my last grandchild. I can’t hold her or my grandson.

The nature of the ambiguity is as follows: I am in a suburban area and I am unsure whether the question gets at any time I might have crossed the threshold of my front door, or if I were to go beyond my property line or, even if leaving home might be defined as going further than I might go on foot (i.e. going on a jog in my neighborhood would still be considered ""staying home"" because I did not go beyond a certain radius from my home).

However, we have a large student population (Western Washington University is in the town) and it seems that many of these young people are socializing in small groups. Perhaps they all live together- college apartments often have many people in them- but it does seem that younger folks are less strict in following the protocols. Most people I talk to also seem to be genuinely trying to follow the order, but a little confused regarding what we should really be doing. Can I bike ride with a friend if we stay six feet apart? Should I be sanitizing my groceries' packaging? Could passing someone on the sidewalk cause a transmission? Grocery stores seem to be the hardest place to maintain distance. Also, since my town is not too far from Seattle, it all feels closer to home and people are trying to socially distance themselves correctly. Additionally, it seems that the fear of unknowingly infecting someone else is a greater motivator than the fear of getting sick yourself. Thank you all for doing this important research and work!
